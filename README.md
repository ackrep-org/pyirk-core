# Overview: pyerk

Pyerk is the python implementation of the ***e**mergent **r**epresentation of **k**nowledge* framework.

- Designed to formally represent knowledge (including meta levels)
- Implementation-status: "early alpha"
- Inspired by OWL, but much more expressive
    - ... at the cost of guarantied computability
- Inspired by Wikidata, but much simpler
- Inspired by SUO-KIF, but with less brackets
- Represented directly in python: → imperative instaead of declarative knowledge representation


Pyerk originated and is currently (2022) mainly developed with focus on representing knowledge from the domain of *control theory* as part of the *Automatic Control Knowledge Repository ([ACKREP](https://ackrep.org))*. However, in principle, it aims to be applicable wo a wide range of domains.
