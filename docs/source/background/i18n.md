# Internationalization

Pyirk aims to support an arbitrary number of languages by so called *language specified strings*. Currently support for English and German is preconfigured in `pyirk.settings`. These language specified strings are instances of the class `rdflib.Literal` where the `.language`-attribute is set to one of the values from `pyirk.setting.SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and can be created like:

```python
from pyirk import de, en

# ...

lss1 = "some english words"@en
lss2 = "ein paar deutsche WÃ¶rter"@de
```

where `en, de` are instances of `pyirk.core.LanguageCode`.

The usage inside Pyirk is best demonstrated by the unittest `test_c02__multilingual_relations`, see [test_core.py](https://github.com/ackrep-org/pyirk-core/blob/main/tests/test_core.py) (maybe change branch).
