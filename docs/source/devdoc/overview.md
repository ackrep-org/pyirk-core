## Test Data


The directory `tests/test_data/ocse_subset` contains an autogenerated subset of the OCSE (ontology of control systems engineering) which is used as real world testing data.

Originally the "real" OCSE data was used for testing. This had the advantage of avoiding double maintaince effort (OCSE  and testing data) but led to increased runtimes of the test suite with the growing number of entities and statements in the OCSE. This is because the test data is loaded and unloaded multiple times to keep the tests (mostly) independent.

To keep the test data small but avoid additional maintaince effort we now automatically extract the relevant entities and statements from the real ocse.
